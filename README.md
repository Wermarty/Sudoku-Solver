# Sudoku-Solver

With my friend and I, we build a robot that can read a sudoku grid, solve it and then write the solution inside the grid using mechatronics stuff.

We used Python, for all the data managment and arduino for controlling motors. There you only have the Python code


Used a RaspberryPi 4B, with a raspberry PiCamera
